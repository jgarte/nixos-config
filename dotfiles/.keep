Here is a humble home for all dotfiles being used on a day-to-day basis.

Since once upon a time the majority of them was templated and SPOT therefore
resides in https://github.com/wiedzmin/rc, templates instantiation tasks there
were modified to place resulting dotfiles in this directory (using some elaborate
layout) in case being run under NixOS.

Generated dotfiles will be commited afterwards, for the sake of not placing
additional semantic link to "rc" repo.

Thereafter we are free to make whatever we want with these dotfiles in the
context of NixOS configuration / home environment.
